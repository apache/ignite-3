Apache Ignite 3
===

Apache Ignite 3 is a distributed database for high-performance computing.

* ACID TRANSACTIONS: Ignite can operate in a strongly consistent mode that provides full support for distributed ACID transactions executed at the Serializable isolation level.
* DISTRIBUTED SQL: Use Ignite as a traditional SQL database by leveraging JDBC drivers, ODBC drivers, or the native SQL APIs that are available for Java, C#, C++, and other programming languages.
* COMPUTE API: With traditional databases, for in-place calculations, you use stored procedures that are written in a language such as PL/SQL. With Ignite, you use modern JVM languages to develop and execute custom tasks across your distributed database.
* SCHEMA-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE: Ignite built around schema-driven model ensuring consistency between DDL, internal models and data.
* PLUGABLE STORAGE ENGINES: Ignite's modular architecture enables the customization of underlying data and metadata storage, offering in-memory storage and RocksDB as default options.
* UNIFIED CLI TOOL AND REST API: Management tools now include built-in CLI and REST API allowing simple access and configuration of Ignite cluster.

## Download

Latest release artifacts (source release and binary packages) are [available](https://ignite.apache.org/download.cgi) from the Ignite web page.

## Quick start

### Run Ignite from released artifact

To start Ignite you need to download latest zip archive from the [Ignite web page](https://ignite.apache.org/download.cgi).
After unpacking it, go to the ignite3-db-3.0.0-beta1 folder and run the following command:

```
bin/ignite3db start
```

After that you need to connect to your node with Ignite CLI:

```
ignite3-cli-3.0.0-beta1/bin/ignite3
```

In CLI you need to initialize simple cluster via the following command:

```
cluster init -n=sampleCluster -m=defaultNode
```

Now CLI can be switched into SQL interactive mode with command:

```
sql
```

In SQL interactive mode user can simply type SQL commands in CLI:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Person (id int primary key,  city varchar,  name varchar,  age int,  company varchar);
INSERT INTO Person (id, city, name, age, company) VALUES ('1', 'London', 'John Doe', '42', 'Apache');
INSERT INTO Person (id, city, name, age, company) VALUES ('2', 'New York', 'Jane Doe', '36', 'Apache');
SELECT * FROM Person;
```

## Build from source

Ignite distributive zip archive can be built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/):

```
./gradlew clean distZip
```

Build artifacts can be found in packaging/db and packaging/cli directories.

## Run from source using Docker

Ignite can be started with the help of Docker:

```
./gradlew docker
cd packaging/docker
docker compose up -d
```
