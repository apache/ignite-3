# Apache Ignite 3 Release Procedure

This document describes the current procedure for preparing an Ignite 3 release.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a GPG key, upload it to a keyserver, and locate its ID. More details here: https://infra.apache.org/openpgp.html
2. Checkout Apache distribution directories:
   ```
   svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/ignite dist-dev
   svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/ignite dist-release
   ```
3. Provide your Apache credentials to Gradle (required for uploading to Apache Nexus) - create or update `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file with the following content:
   ```
   staging_user=*INSERT STAGING USERNAME HERE*
   staging_password=*INSERT STAGING PASSWORD HERE*
   ```
   (do NOT put secrets into `gradle.properties` in the project dir - see [Gradle docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html) for more details).

For all the commands going forward:
* Replace `{version}` with the version number being released.
* Replace `{rc}` with the current sequential number of the release candidate.
* Replace `{gpg}` with your GPG key ID.
* Replace `{dist.dev}` with the local path to the development distribution directory.
* Replace `{dist.release}` with the local path to the release distribution directory.

## Preparing the Release

1. Go to the project home folder.
2. Update RELEASE_NOTES.txt with the changes since the last release. Commit and push to the `main` branch.
3. Update versions in `main` branch to the next development version (e.g., `x.y.z-SNAPSHOT`):
   * Update `gradle.properties` manually.
   * Run `./gradlew :platforms:updateVersion` to update platforms versions (.NET, C++, Python, etc.)
   * Commit and push changes.
4. Create and push a new branch for the release `ignite-{version}`.
5. Update versions in `ignite-{version}` branch to the current release version, remove `-SNAPSHOT` suffix - same steps as in point 3.
6. Create a Git tag from `ignite-{version}` branch head:
   ```
   git tag -a {version}-rc{rc} -m "{version}-rc{rc}"
   git push --tags
   ```
7. Setup Gradle properties - create or update `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file with the following content:
   ```
   signing.keyId=*INSERT KEY HERE LAST 8 CHARS*
   signing.password=*INSERT PASSWORD HERE*
   signing.secretKeyRingFile=*INSERT KEY RING ABSOLUTE PATH HERE*
   ```
   (do NOT put secrets into `gradle.properties` in the project dir - see [Gradle docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html) for more details).
   To generate a secret key ring file use the following command
   ```
   gpg --keyring secring.gpg --export-secret-keys > ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
   ```
   Show key id command (you need only last 8 chars from printed key)
   ```
   gpg -K
   ```
8. Build the project, sign the artifact and create a staging repository:
   ```
   ./gradlew publishAllPublicationsToMavenRepository
   ```
9. Login to the Apache Nexus and close the new repository: https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories
10. Create an empty folder under the development distribution directory:
   ```
   rm -rf {dist.dev}/{version}-rc{rc}
   mkdir {dist.dev}/{version}-rc{rc}
   ```
11. Create ZIP, DEB, RPM packages, .NET and C++ client, sign them and create checksums:
   ```
   ./gradlew -PprepareRelease prepareRelease
   ```
12. Copy all packages along with checksums and signatures to the development distribution directory:
   ```
   cp packaging/build/release/* {dist.dev}/{version}-rc{rc}
   ```
13. Commit ZIP and DEB\RPM packages:
   ```
   cd {dist.dev}
   svn add {version}-rc{rc}
   svn commit -m “Apache Ignite {version} RC{rc}”
   ``` 
14. Put the release on a vote on the developers mailing list.

## Finalizing the Release

Perform the following actions ONLY after the vote is successful and closed.

1. Login to the Apache Nexus and release the staging repository: https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories
2. Create an empty folder under the release distribution directory:
   ```
   rm -rf {dist.release}/{version}
   mkdir {dist.release}/{version}
   ```
3. Copy ZIP packages along with checksums and signatures to the release distribution directory:
   ```
   cp {dist.dev}/{version}-rc{rc}/* {dist.release}/{version}
   ```
4. Commit ZIP packages:
   ```
   cd {dist.release}
   svn add {version}
   svn commit -m “Apache Ignite {version}”
   ```
5. Build and publish the documentation - see docs/README.adoc
   * Push to https://github.com/apache/ignite-website/tree/master/docs/ignite3 
6. Build and publish API docs
   * Java: `./gradlew aggregateJavadoc`
   * .NET: `./gradlew :platforms:aggregateDotnetDocs`
   * C++: `./gradlew :platforms:doxygenCppClient`
   * Push to https://github.com/apache/ignite-website/tree/master/releases
7. Publish Docker images: `./gradlew :packaging:docker` (TODO - see [IGNITE-24408](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-24408))
8. Publish NuGet packages:
   * Get API key from https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/pmc/ignite/credentials/nuget.org (PMC only)
   * `for i in *.nupkg; do dotnet nuget push $i -k API_KEY_HERE -s "https://nuget.org/"; done`
9. Publish Python packages (TODO [IGNITE-24327](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-24327))
10. Update https://ignite.apache.org/download.cgi page - see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/IGNITE/Website+Development
