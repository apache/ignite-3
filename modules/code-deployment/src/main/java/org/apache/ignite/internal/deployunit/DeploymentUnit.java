 * Interface representing a deployment unit in the Apache Ignite code deployment system.
 * 
 * <p>A deployment unit is a container for code and resources that can be deployed to and managed 
 * within an Ignite cluster. This interface provides a contract for processing deployment unit 
 * content through a processor pattern, allowing for flexible handling of different types of 
 * deployment units such as regular file-based units and ZIP-compressed units.

     * following a strategy pattern. The processor determines how the unit content should be
     * handled based on its implementation. Different processors can perform different operations
     * on the same deployment unit.
     * 
     * <p>The method supports generic type parameters to allow processors to work with different
     * argument types and return different result types, providing flexibility for various
     * processing scenarios.
