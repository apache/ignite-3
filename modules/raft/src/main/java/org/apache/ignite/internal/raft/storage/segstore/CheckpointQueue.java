/**
 * A blocking queue implementation tailored to be used by the {@link RaftLogCheckpointer}.
 *
 * <p>This queue only supports the following access scenario:
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>One thread writes to the queue at a time, adding new entries via the {@link #add} call;</li>
 *     <li>One thread peeks at the head of the queue via the {@link #peek} method and, possibly after some time, removes the head
 *     using the {@link #removeHead} method. Since only one thread performs these actions, there's no need for additional synchronization
 *     between the {@code peek} and {@code removeHead} calls.</li>
 *     <li>Multiple threads can read from the queue using the {@link #tailIterator} method.</li>
 * </ol>
