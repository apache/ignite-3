PrimaryReplica -> Replica1 : Send a changePeersAndLearnersAsync request (node is the leader at the moment)
Replica1 -> Replica1 : Leader was stepped down and new leader election will start.
Replica2 -> Replica2 : Current node elected as a leader.
Replica2 -> PrimaryReplica : Send a message about the new leader elected. [see 3.1 details]
PrimaryReplica -> PrimaryReplica : Check local state for ongoing rebalance for the replica group.
note left
we can use local state here,
because if the PrimaryReplica fails,
PlacementDriver will choose another one
and start rebalance again by himself
end note
PrimaryReplica -> Replica2 : Send changePeersAndLearners to the new leader again
Replica2 -> PrimaryReplica : Rebalance done message
PrimaryReplica -> PlacementDriver : Rebalance done message. PD than do other operations from the general rebalance diagram.
