/**
 * This annotation marks the class as a polymorphic configuration schema. Has basically the same properties as a {@link Config}, but it
 * should be treated like an abstract class in java.
 *
 * <p>To change the type of polymorphic configuration, you must use the {@code PolymorphicConfigChange#convert}.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: {@link PolymorphicId} field must be present, you should explicitly declare that, also at least one
 * {@link PolymorphicConfigInstance} is required.
