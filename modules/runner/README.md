# Ignite cluster & node lifecycle
This document describes user-level and component-level cluster lifecycles and their mutual interaction.

## Node lifecycle
A node maintains its' local state in the local persistent key-value storage named vault. The data stored in the vault is 
semantically divided in the following categories:
 * User-level local configuration properties (such as memory limits, network timeouts, etc). User-level configuration
 properties can be written both at runtime (not all properties will be applied at runtime, however, - some of them will
 require a full node restart) and when a node is shut down (in order to be able to change properties that prevent node
 startup for some reason)
 * System-level private properties (such as computed local statistics, node-local commin paths, etc). System-level 
 private properties are computed locally based on the information available at node locally (not based on metastorage 
 watched values)
 * System-level distributed metastorage projected properties (such as paths to partition files, etc). System-level 
 projected properties are associated with one or more metastorage properties and are computed based on the local node 
 state and the metastorage properties values. System-level projected properties values are semantically bound to a 
 particular revision of the dependee properties and must be recalculated when dependees are changed (see 
 [reliable watch processing](#reliable-watch-processing)). 

The vault is created during the first node startup and optionally populated with the paremeters from the configuration 
file passed in to the ``ignite node start`` [command](TODO link to CLI readme). Only user-level properties can be 
written via the provided file. 

System-level properties are written to the storage during the first vault initialization by the node start process. 
Projected properties are not initialized during the initial node startup because at this point the local node is not 
aware of the distributed metastorage. The node remains in a 'zombie' state until after it learns that there is an 
initialized metastorage (either via the ``ignite cluster init`` [command](TODO link to CLI readme) during the initial 
cluster initialization) or from the group membershup service via gossip (implying that group membership protocol is 
working at this point).

### Node components startup
For testability purposes, we require that component dependencies are defined upfront and provided at the construction
time. This additionaly requires that component dependencies form no cycles. Therefore, components form an acyclic 
directed graph that is constructed in topological sort order wrt root. 

Components created and initialized also in an order consistent with a topological sort of the components graph. This 
enforces serveral rules related to the components interaction: 
 * Since metastorage watches can only be added during the component startup, the watch notification order is consistent
 with the component initialization order. I.e. if a component `B` depdends on a component `A`, then `A` receives watch
 notification prior to `B`.
 * Dependent component can directly call an API method on a dependee component (because it can obtain the dependee 
 reference during construction). Direct inverse calls are prohibited (this is enforced by only acquiring component 
 references during the components construction). Nevertheless, inverse call can be implemented by means of listeners or 
 callbacks: the dependent component installs a listener to a dependeee, which can be later invoked.

The diagram above shows the component dependency diagram and provides an order in which compomnents may be initialized.

## Cluster lifecycle
For a cluster to become operational, the metastorage instance must be initialized first. The initialization command 
chooses a set of nodes (normally, 3 - 5 nodes) to host the distributed metastorage Raft group. When a node receives the 
initialization command, it either creates a bootstrapped Raft instance with the given members (if this is a metastorage 
group node), or writes the metastorage group member IDs to the vault as a private system-level property.

After the metastorage is initialized, components start to receive and process watch events, updating the local state 
according to the changes received from the watch.

An entry point to user-initiated cluster state changes is [cluster configuration](../configuration/README.md). 
Configuration module provides convenient ways for managing configuration both as Java API, as well as from ``ignite`` 
command line utility.

## Reliable configuration changes
Any configuration change is translated to a metastorage multi-update and has a single configuration change ID. This ID
is used to enforce CAS-style configuration changes and to ensure no duplicate configuration changes are executed during
the cluster runtime. To reliably process cluster configuration changes, we introduce an additional metastorage key

```
internal.configuration.applied=<change ID>
```

that indicates the configuration change ID that was already processed and corresponding changes are written to the 
metastorage. Whenever a node processes a configuration change, it must also conditionally update the 
``internal.configuration.applied`` value checking that the previous value is smaller than the change ID being applied.
This prevents configuration changes being processed more than once. Any metastorage update that processes configuration
change must update this key to indicate that this configuraion change has been already processed. It is safe to process
the same configuration change more than once since only one update will be applied. 

## Reliable watch processing
All cluster state is written and maintained in the metastorage. Nodes may update some state in the metastorage, which
may require a recomputation of some other metastorage properties (for example, when cluster baseline changes, Ignite
needs to recalculate table affinity assignments). In other words, some properties in the metastore are dependent on each
other and we may need to reliably update one property in response to an update to another.

To facilitate this pattern, Ignite uses the metastorage ability to replay metastorage changes from a certain revision
called [watch](TODO link to metastorage watch). To process watch updates reliably, we associate a special persistent 
value called ``applied revision`` (stored in the vault) with each watch. We rely on the following assumptions about the 
reliable watch processing:
 * Watch execution is idempotent (if the same watch event is processed twice, the second watch invocation will have no 
 effect on the system). This is usually enforced by conditional multi-update operations for the metastorage and 
 deterministic projected properties calculations. The conditional multi-update should check that the revision of the key
 being updated matches the revision observed with the watch's event upper bound.
 * All properties read inside the watch must be read with the upper bound equal to the watch event revision.
 * If watch processing initiates a metastorage update, the ``applied revision`` is propagated only after the metastorage
 confirmed that the proposed change is committed (note that in this case it does not matter whether this particular 
 multi-update succeeds or not: we know that the first multi-update will succeed, and all further updates are idempotent,
 so we need to make sure that at least one multi-update is committed).
 * If watch processing initiates projected keys writes to the vault, the keys must be written atomically with the 
 updated ``applied revision`` value.
 * If a watch initiates metastorage properties update, it should only be deployed on the metastorage group members to
 avoid massive identical updates being issued to the metastorage (TODO: should really be only the leader of the 
 metastorage Raft group).

In a case of a crash, each watch is restared from the revision stored in the corresponding ``applied revision`` variable
of the watch, and not processed events are replayed.

### Example: `CREATE TABLE` flow
We require that each Ignite table is assigned a globally unique ID (the ID must not repeat even after the table is 
dropped, so we use the metastorage key revision to assign table IDs).

To create a table, a user makes a change in the configuration tree by introducing the corresponding configuration 
object. This can be done either via public [configuration API](TODO link to configuration API) or via the ``ignite`` 
[configuration command](TODO link to CLI readme). Configuration validator checks that a table with the same name does
not exist (and performs other necessary checks) and writes the change to the metastorage. If the update succeeds, Ignite
considers the table created and completes user call.

After the configuration change is applied, the table manager receives configuration change notification (essentially, 
a transformed watch) on metastorage group nodes. Table manager uses configuration keys update counters (not revision)
as table IDs and attempts to create the following keys (updating the ``internal.configuration.applied`` key as was 
described above): 

```
internal.tables.<ID>=<name>
```  

In order to process affinity calculations and assignments, the affinity manager creates a reliable watch for the 
following keys on metastorage group members:

```
internal.tables.*
internal.baseline
``` 

Whenever a watch is fired, the affinity manager checks which key was updated. If the watch is triggered for 
``internal.tables.<ID>`` key, it calculates a new affinity for the table with the given ID. If the watch is triggered 
for ``internal.baseline`` key, the manager recalculates affinity for all tables exsiting at the watch revision 
(this can be done using the metastorage ``range(keys, upperBound)`` method providing the watch event revision as the 
upper bound). The calculated affinity is written to the ``internal.tables.affinity.<ID>`` key.

> Note that ideally the watch should only be processed on metastorage group leader, thus eliminating unnecessary network
> trips. Theoretically, we could have embedded this logic to the state machine, but this would enormously complicate 
> the cluster updates and put metastorage consistency at risk. 

To handle partition assignments, partition manager creates a reliable watch for the affinity assignment key on all 
nodes:

```
internal.tables.affinity.<ID>
```

Whenever a watch is fired, the node checks whether there exist new partitions assigned to the local node, and if there 
are, the node bootstraps corresponding Raft partition servers (i.e. allocates paths to Raft logs and storage files). 
The allocation information is written to projected vault keys:

```
local.tables.partition.<ID>.<PARTITION_ID>.logpath=/path/to/raft/log
local.tables.partition.<ID>.<PARTITION_ID>.storagepath=/path/to/storage/file
``` 

Once the projected keys are synced to the vault, the partition manager can create partition Raft servers (initialize 
the log and storage, write hard state, register message handlers, etc). Upon startup, the node checks the existing 
projected keys (finishing the raft log and storage initialization in case it crashed in the midst) and starts the Raft
servers.

### Stop node flow.
It's possible to stop node both when node was already started or during the startup process, in that case
node stop will prevent any new components startup and stop already started ones.

Following method was added to Ignition interface:
```
    /**
     * Stops the node with given {@code name}.
     * It's possible to stop both already started node or node that is currently starting.
     * Has no effect if node with specified name doesn't exist.
     *
     * @param name Node name to stop.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if null is specified instead of node name.
     */
    public void stop(String name);
```
It's also possible to stop a node by calling ``close()`` on an already started Ignite instance.

As a starting point stop process checks node status:
 * If it's STOPPING - nothing happens, cause previous intention to stop node was already detected.
 * If it's STARTING (means that node is somewhere in the middle of the startup process) - node status will be updated to
STOPPING and later on startup process will detect status change on attempt of starting next component, prevent further
startup process and stop already started managers and corresponding inner components.
 * if it's STARTED - explicit stop will take an action. All components will be stopped.

In all cases the node stop process consists of two phases:
 * At phase one ``onNodeStop()`` will be called on all started components in reverse order, meaning that the last
  started component will run ``onNodeStop()`` first. For most components ``onNodeStop()`` will be No-op. Core idea here
   is to stop network communication on ``onNodeStop()`` in order to terminate distributed operations gracefully:
   no network communication is allowed but node local logic still remains consistent.
 * At phase two within a write busy lock, ``stop()`` will be called on all started components also in reverse order, 
 here thread stopping logic, inner structures cleanup and other related logic takes it time. Please pay attention that
  at this point network communication isn't possible.

Besides local node stopping logic two more actions took place on a cluster as a result of node left event:
 * Both range and watch cursors will be removed on server side. Given process is linearized with meta storage
  operations by using a meta storage raft.
 * Baseline update and corresponding baseline recalculation with ongoing partition raft groups redeployment.
