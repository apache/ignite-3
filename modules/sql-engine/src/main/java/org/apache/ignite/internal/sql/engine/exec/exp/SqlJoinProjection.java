 * A functional interface representing a projection specifically designed for SQL join operations.

 * It allows to fuse rows concatenation and consequent projection (for example, restoring original order of columns
 * after join input was switched), reducing the need for additional post-join transformations and optimizing
 * query execution.
 *
 * @param <RowT> The type of the execution row.
