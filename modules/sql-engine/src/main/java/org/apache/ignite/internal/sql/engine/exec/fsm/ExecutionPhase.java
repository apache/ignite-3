/**
 * Enumerates possible phases of query execution.
 *
 * <p>This enum is a sort of transition graph since generally there is exactly one transition on a normal execution path. The one exception
 * is {@link #PARSING} phase where path diverges to {@link #OPTIMIZING} and {@link #CURSOR_INITIALIZATION}. Also, it's allowed to move to
 * {@link #TERMINATED} phase from any other phase (usually, in case of exception).
 *
 * <p>Currently, there are following transitions:
 * <pre>
 *     For single statement execution:
 *     REGISTERED --> PARSING --> OPTIMIZING --> CURSOR_INITIALIZATION --> EXECUTING --> TERMINATED
 *
 *     For script execution:
 *     REGISTERED --> PARSING --> SCRIPT_INITIALIZATION --> EXECUTING --> TERMINATED
 *
 *     For single statement execution spawned by script:
 *     REGISTERED --> OPTIMIZING --> CURSOR_INITIALIZATION --> EXECUTING --> TERMINATED
 * </pre>
