     *     <li>storage revision update happens and the future for token N completes with value V3.</li>
     * </ul>
     * Regardless of order in which this method's calls are made, V3 should be the final result.
     * <br>
     * The method should return a future that will be completed when {@code updater} completes.
     *
     * @param causalityToken Causality token. Used mainly for sanity checks.
     * @param updater The binary function that accepts previous value and exception, if present, and update it to compute the new
