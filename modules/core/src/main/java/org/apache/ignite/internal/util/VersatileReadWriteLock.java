/**
 * A versatile read-write lock that can be used both in synchronous and asynchronous contexts.
 * Its blocking methods use the spinwait strategy. When they do so, they are not interruptible (that is, they do not break their loop on
 * interruption signal).
 *
 * <p>The locks are NOT reentrant (that is, the same thread can NOT acquire the same lock a few times without releasing it).
 *
 * <p>Write lock acquire requests are prioritized over read lock acquire requests. That is, if both read and write lock
 * acquire requests are received when the write lock is held by someone else, then, on its release, the write lock attempt will be served
 * first.
 *
 * <p>Lock owners are not tracked.
 *
 * <p>Asynchronous locking methods may complete the futures either in the calling thread (if they were able to immediately acquire
 * the requested lock) or in the supplied pool (if they had to wait for a release to happen before being able to satisfy the request).
 *
 * <p>Asynchronous locking methods never use spin loops. They do use CAS loops, but these are mostly very short.
