     *     // Here, we are selecting all reserved rooms on a particular floor. All reservation are colocated by {@code floor_no},
     *     // therefore having predicate like {@code floor_no = ?} make it possible to compute a partition which keeps the data of
     *     // interest. Which in turn makes it possible to send the query directly to the node that hold the relevant data.
     *     SELECT room_no FROM RoomsReservations WHERE floor_no = ?;
     *
     *     // Similar with INSERT: since values of dynamic parameters are known on a client, it makes it possible to route the
     *     // query directly to the node that hold the relevant data.
     *     INSERT INTO RoomsReservations(room_no, floor_no) VALUES(?, ?);
