# Ignite Network AnnontationProcessor module

This module is a complement for the Ignite Networking Module and provides interfaces and annotations related to network
messages and their content. It also provides a series of annotation processors for code generation.

This module provides the following key classes:

1. `NetworkMessage` — base interface for all network messages.
2. `MessageSerializer` and `MessageDeserializer` — custom (de-)serializers for a particular network message. 
   Instances of these interfaces should usually be generated by the annotation processor provided by this module.
3. `MessageSerializationFactory` — factory for creating (de-)serializers. It needs to be registered in a 
   `MessageSerializationRegistry`, which acts as a bridge between this module and the Networking module.
4. `@AutoSerializable` — annotation for marking `NetworkMessage` implementations. Such implementations will be taken
   into account by the annotation processor when generating corresponding `MessageSerializer`, `MessageDeserializer`
   and `MessageSerializationFactory` instances.
