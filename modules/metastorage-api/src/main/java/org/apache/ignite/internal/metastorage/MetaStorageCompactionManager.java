     * Compacts outdated key versions and removes tombstones of metastorage locally.
     *
     * <p>We do not compact the only and last version of the key unless it is a tombstone.</p>
     *
     * <p>Let's look at some examples, let's say we have the following keys with their versions:</p>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Key "foo" with versions that have revisions (1, 3, 5) - "foo" [1, 3, 5].</li>
     *     <li>Key "bar" with versions that have revisions (1, 2, 5) the last revision is a tombstone - "bar" [1, 2, 5 tomb].</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Let's look at examples of invoking the current method and what will be in the storage after:</p>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Compaction revision is {@code 1}: "foo" [3, 5], "bar" [2, 5 tomb].</li>
     *     <li>Compaction revision is {@code 2}: "foo" [3, 5], "bar" [5 tomb].</li>
     *     <li>Compaction revision is {@code 3}: "foo" [5], "bar" [5 tomb].</li>
     *     <li>Compaction revision is {@code 4}: "foo" [5], "bar" [5 tomb].</li>
     *     <li>Compaction revision is {@code 5}: "foo" [5].</li>
     *     <li>Compaction revision is {@code 6}: "foo" [5].</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Compaction revision is expected to be less than the current metastorage revision.</p>
     *
     * <p>Since the node may stop or crash, after restoring the node on its startup we need to run the compaction for the latest known
     * compaction revision.</p>
     *
     * <p>Compaction revision is not updated or saved.</p>
     *
     * @param revision Revision up to which (including) the metastorage keys will be compacted.
     * @throws IgniteInternalException with cause {@link NodeStoppingException} if the node is in the process of stopping.
     * @throws MetaStorageException If there is an error during the metastorage compaction process.
