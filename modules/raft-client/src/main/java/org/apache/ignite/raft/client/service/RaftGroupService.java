/**
 * A service providing operations on a replication group.
 * <p>
 * Most of operations require a known group leader. The group leader can be refreshed at any time by calling
 * {@link #refreshLeader()} method, otherwise it will happen automatically on a first call.
 * <p>
 * If a leader has been changed while the operation in progress, the operation will be transparently retried until
 * timeout is reached. The current leader will be refreshed automatically (maybe several times) in the process.
 * <p>
 * Each asynchronous method (returning a future) uses a default timeout to finish, see {@link #timeout()}.
 * If a result is not available within the timeout, the future will be completed with a {@link TimeoutException}
 * <p>
 * If an error is occured during operation execution, the future will be completed with the corresponding
 * IgniteException having an error code and a related message.
 * <p>
 * All async operations provided by the service are not cancellable.
