/**
 * Raft manager.
 *
 * <p>This class contains two groups of methods for starting Raft nodes: {@code #startRaftGroupNode} and
 * {@code startRaftGroupNodeAndWaitNodeReadyFuture} (and its overloads). When using {@code #startRaftGroupNode}, Raft log re-application
 * does not get performed and external synchronisation methods must be used to avoid observing a Raft node in inconsistent state. The other
 * group of methods synchronously waits for the Raft log to be re-applied, so no external synchronisation is required.
 *
 * <p>Usually Raft recovery is done synchronously, but sometimes there's an implicit dependency between Raft nodes, where the recovery of
 * one node triggers the recovery of the other and vice versa. In this case, {@code #startRaftGroupNode} group of methods should be used
 * to avoid deadlocks during Raft node startup.
