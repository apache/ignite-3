# This is the **HOMEPAGE**.
Refer to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for how to write markdown files.
## Quick Start Notes:
1. Add images to the *images* folder if the file is referencing an image.

# TODO
1. Ignite icon
2. Update DEVNOTES - explain how to build the docs
3. Integrate with Gradle
    * Run the docfx build as part of the build process when platforms are included
    * Copy resulting docs somewhere?
