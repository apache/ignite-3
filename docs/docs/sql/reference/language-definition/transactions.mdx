# Transactions

A transaction is a sequence of SQL operations that starts with the `START TRANSACTION` statement and ends with the `COMMIT` statement. Either the effect of all operations will be published, or no results will be published at all.

:::warning
Transaction control statements are only allowed within a [script](/docs/3.1.0/sql/working-with-sql/execute-queries).
:::

In Apache Ignite 3, you start the transaction by using the `START TRANSACTION` statement:

<RailroadDiagram>{`
Diagram(
Terminal('START TRANSACTION'),
ZeroOrMore(
Terminal('READ ONLY'),
Terminal('READ WRITE')))
`}</RailroadDiagram>

:::note
DDL statements are not supported inside transactions.
:::

Parameters:

- `READ WRITE` - both read and write operations are allowed in the transaction. Used by default.
- `READ ONLY` - only read operations are allowed in the transaction.

You close and commit the transaction by using the `COMMIT` statement:

<RailroadDiagram>{`
Diagram(
Terminal('COMMIT'))
`}</RailroadDiagram>

## Example

The example below inserts 3 lines into the table in a single transaction, ensuring they will all be committed together:

```sql
START TRANSACTION READ WRITE;

INSERT INTO Person (id, name, surname) VALUES (1, 'John', 'Smith');
INSERT INTO Person (id, name, surname) VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Smith');
INSERT INTO Person (id, name, surname) VALUES (3, 'Adam', 'Mason');

COMMIT;
```
