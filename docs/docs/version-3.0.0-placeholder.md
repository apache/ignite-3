# Version 3.0.0 Documentation Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for Apache Ignite 3.0.0 documentation.

## Status

The 3.0.0 documentation will be added in a future migration phase.

## Current Version

The current documentation version is 3.1.0. Use the version dropdown in the navigation bar to switch between versions once 3.0.0 content is available.

## Migration Plan

According to the project plan (IGNITE-26681), the 3.0.0 documentation structure will be created as a versioned docs set using Docusaurus versioning features.

To add 3.0.0 documentation:
1. Prepare 3.0.0 content
2. Run: `npm run docusaurus docs:version 3.0.0`
3. This will create a `versioned_docs/version-3.0.0/` directory
4. Move 3.0.0 content into that directory
5. Update `versions.json` configuration
