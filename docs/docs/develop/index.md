# Develop

Build applications with Apache Ignite 3 using native clients, SQL drivers, and framework integrations.

## In This Section

### [Ignite Clients](./ignite-clients/)

Full-featured native clients for Java, .NET, and C++ with support for all Ignite APIs.

- **[Java Client](./ignite-clients/java-client)** - Primary API with complete feature set
- **[.NET Client](./ignite-clients/dotnet-client)** - Native .NET client for C# applications
- **[C++ Client](./ignite-clients/cpp-client)** - High-performance C++ client

### Connect to Ignite

SQL-only connectivity through standard database drivers.

- **[JDBC Driver](./connect-to-ignite/jdbc)** - Java Database Connectivity
- **[ODBC Driver](./connect-to-ignite/odbc)** - Open Database Connectivity
- **[Python DB-API](./connect-to-ignite/python)** - Python database API (PEP-249)

### Work with Data

APIs and patterns for data manipulation and processing.

- **[Use the Table API](./work-with-data/table-api)** - Key-value and record-based data access
- **[Execute SQL Queries](./work-with-data/table-api)** - Programmatic SQL execution
- **[Work with Transactions](./work-with-data/transactions)** - ACID transaction support
- **[Stream Data](./work-with-data/streaming)** - High-throughput data streaming
- **[Deploy Code](./work-with-data/code-deployment)** - Deploy compute jobs to cluster
- **[Handle Events](./work-with-data/events)** - React to cluster events
- **[Map Java Objects to Tables](./work-with-data/java-to-tables)** - Object-relational mapping

### Integrate

Framework integrations for Spring ecosystem.

- **[Spring Boot Integration](./integrate/spring-boot)** - Auto-configuration and starters
- **[Spring Data Integration](./integrate/spring-data)** - Repository pattern support
