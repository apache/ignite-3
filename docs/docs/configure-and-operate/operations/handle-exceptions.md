This section outlines basic exceptions that can be generated by Apache Ignite and provides basic instructions for handling them.

## Finding Stack Trace Information

When the exception happens, Apache Ignite provides a UUID of the specific exception, but not a full stack trace. For a full stack trace, check cluster logs.

## Common Exceptions

| Exception Code | Description | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|
| `IGN-CMN-1` | Operation was stopped because node is stopping. | Check that the cluster is up and running and try again. |
| `IGN-CMN-2` | Operation was stopped because the component is not started. | Wait for the node to complete the startup process and start all components. |
| `IGN-CMN-3` | Operation failed because an illegal argument or argument in a wrong format has been passed. | Check the exception message for additional information. Specific actions depend on the operation that triggered the error. |
| `IGN-CMN-4` | Operation failed because SSL could not be configured. | Check the exception message for more information and update the configuration. |
| `IGN-CMN-5` | Operation failed because a node has left the cluster. | Wait for the node to return to the cluster, or use a different node. |
| `IGN-CMN-6` | Operation failed because the cursor is already closed. | Check the exception message to find out why the cursor was closed before the operation. |
| `IGN-CMN-7` | An error occurred while closing resources. | Check the exception message to find out why the resource was closed before the operation. |
| `IGN-CMN-8` | An error occurred while marshalling or unmarshalling objects. | |
| `IGN-CMN-9` | The method cannot return a null value. | |
| `IGN-CMN-65535` | Internal error has occurred. | This an unexpected internal error in Apache Ignite. In most cases, receiving it indicates a bug. |

## Table Exceptions

| Exception Code | Description | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|
| `IGN-TBL-1` | Table already exists. | Make sure to use the table name that does not exist on the cluster. |
| `IGN-TBL-2` | Table not found. | Check the table name and, if necessary, create it. |
| `IGN-TBL-3` | Column already exists. | Make sure to use the column name that does not exist in the table. |
| `IGN-TBL-4` | Column not found. | Check the column name and, if necessary, create it. |
| `IGN-TBL-5` | Schema version mismatch. | The request uses a different schema than the table. |
| `IGN-TBL-6` | Partition type not supported. | Use a supported partition type. |

## Client Exceptions

| Exception Code | Description | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|
| `IGN-CLIENT-1` | Connection to client failed. This error is usually caused by incorrect address or connection timeout. | Check the exception message. If a timeout occurred, make sure the timeout values in client and server configurations allow for long-running requests. |
| `IGN-CLIENT-2` | An issue occurred with connection protocol. This error can be caused by using an incompatible client version or data corruption. | Check the exception message. If data corruption occurred, recover the data. If client versions are not compatible, use the correct client version. |
| `IGN-CLIENT-3` | Protocol version does not support a specific feature. Typically this is caused by version mismatch between client and server. | Update the client or the server to a newer version or do not use incompatible features. |
| `IGN-CLIENT-4` | Failed to find the table by ID. | Check if the table ID is correct. |
| `IGN-CLIENT-5` | An error occurred with client configuration. | Check the exception message for more information and fix the client configuration. |
| `IGN-CLIENT-6` | Cluster ID mismatch. This error can be caused by the client connecting to multiple different clusters. | Check client configuration to make sure all endpoints belong to the same cluster. |
| `IGN-CLIENT-7` | Client SSL configuration is not valid. | Check the exception message for more information. Make sure SSL configuration matches server-side configuration. |
| `IGN-CLIENT-8` | Client handshake message error. This is usually caused by the client trying to connect to a wrong endpoint (for example, REST) or a non-Apache Ignite process is trying to connect to a Apache Ignite endpoint. | Check the exception message for more information. If the issue is with client, check and fix client configuration. If a third-party client is trying to connect, check what it is and fix the configuration. |

Additional exception categories (SQL, Index, Transactions, Replicator, Storage, Distribution Zone, Network, Node Configuration, Code Deployment, Authentication, Compute, Catalog, Critical Workers, Disaster Recovery, Metastorage) follow the same format with their specific error codes and recommended actions.
