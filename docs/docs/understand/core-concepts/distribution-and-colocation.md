# Distribution and Colocation

Data is distributed across cluster nodes using partitioning. Colocation ensures related data is stored together for optimal query performance.

Distribution is controlled through distribution zones, which define how data is partitioned and replicated across the cluster.

For details on configuring distribution, see the [Distribution Zones documentation](/docs/3.1.0/sql/reference/language-definition/distribution-zones).
