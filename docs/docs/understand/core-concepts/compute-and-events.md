For details on using compute, see the [Compute API documentation](/docs/3.1.0/developers-guide/compute).

## Event Notifications

Ignite 3 provides event notifications for monitoring cluster state and data changes.

For details on events, see the [Events documentation](/docs/3.1.0/developers-guide/events).
