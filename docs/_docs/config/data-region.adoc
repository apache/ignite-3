= Data Region Configuration

You can set configuration for data regions by using HOCON format. You can configure your data regions to run either RocksDB or B+Tree storage, and fine-tune their performance. A cluster can have several data regions, and you can select the preferred storage type for each. Configuration parameters for data regions are available in the storage-related articles.

We recommend to use B+Tree storage for read-heavy workloads, and RocksDB for write-heavy workloads.


== Configuration Example

The example below shows how to configure two data regions, one using RocksDB storage, and another using a volatile page memory:

----
ignite config set --type cluster \
"{
    rocksdb.regions: [{
        name: lsm_region,
        size: 256000000,
        cache: lru
    }],

    aimem.regions: [{
        name: btree_volatile_region,
        maxSize: 256000000
    }]
}"
