= Storage Engines and Profiles

== Storage Engines

Storage engines in Apache Ignite 3 are responsible for storing data on disk or in memory.

Storage engines are configured at the node level in the node configuration under the `ignite.storage.engines` section and are referenced by storage profiles, which are then used by distribution zones.

To check available storage engines on a node, use:

[source]
----
node config show ignite.storage.engines
----

== Storage Profiles

Storage profiles reference a specific engine and provide configuration parameters for that engine. Profiles are defined under the `ignite.storage.profiles` section and can be referenced by distribution zones when creating tables.

To check available storage profiles on a node, use:

[source]
----
node config show ignite.storage.profiles
----

== Scope of Configuration

Storage engine configuration is node-local, meaning each node in the cluster can have different engine configurations. While tables, zones, and profile names are cluster-wide, the actual implementation of a storage profile is specific to each node. This allows for flexibility in configuring storage characteristics based on the hardware capabilities of individual nodes.

When tables use a specific storage profile, they will be stored on each node according to that node's local configuration of the specified profile. If a node does not have a required profile configured, it will not be able to store the table data.
