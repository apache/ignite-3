= Configuring Metrics

Metrics collection might affect the performance of an application. So, by default all metric sources are disabled.

== Metrics Management

All metric management is performed through the link:ignite-cli-tool[Ignite CLI tool].

=== Checking Metric Sources and Enabled Metrics

The Ignite CLI tool can list all available metric sources:

[source, bash]
----
node metric source list
----

This command lists all metric sources. To check the list of metrics, enable the metric source you need and then use the following command:

[source, bash]
----
node metric list
----

This command will return the list of all currently available metrics, organized with their exporters.

=== Enabling Metric Sources

Metric sources are enabled on per-node basis. You can specify the node interact with by using the `-u` parameter to specify node URL or `-n` parameter to specify node name. For example, here is how you can enable `jvm` metric source:

[source, bash]
----
node metric source enable -n=defaultNode jvm
----

=== Disabling Metric Sources

Metric sources are also disabled on per-node basis. You can specify the node interact with by using the `-u` parameter to specify node URL or `-n` parameter to specify node name. For example, here is how you can enable `jvm` metric source:

[source, bash]
----
node metric source disable -n=defaultNode jvm
----

== Accessing Metrics

// Might add about  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099 as a way to hard link port later

You can work with metrics by using any external tool. To access the metrics, you need to enable the jmx exporter in cluster configuration:

----
—Åluster config update metrics.exporters.jmx.exporterName=jmx
----

After you do, monitoring tools will be able to collect enabled metrics from the node:
