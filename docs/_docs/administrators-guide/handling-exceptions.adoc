= Errors and Solutions

This section outlines basic exceptions that can be generated by Apache Ignite and provides basic instructions for handling them.

== Finding Stack Trace Information

When the exception happens, Apache Ignite provides a UUID of the specific exception, but not a full stack trace. For a full stack trace, check cluster logs.

== Authentication Exceptions

[cols="20%,40%, 40%", width="100%",opts="header"]
|===
|Exception Code	|Description|Recommended Action

|`IGN-AUTHENTICATION-1`|Authentication error caused by unsupported authentication type.|Check the client configuration and use the supported configuration type.
|`IGN-AUTHENTICATION-2`|Authentication error caused by invalid credentials.|Check and correct user credentials.
|`IGN-AUTHENTICATION-3`|Basic authentication provider is not found.|Configure basic authentication provider.
|===

== Catalog Exceptions

[cols="20%,40%, 40%", width="100%",opts="header"]
|===
|Exception Code	|Description|Recommended Action

|`IGN-CATALOG-1`|Command to the catalog has not passed the validation.| See the exception message for details. Typically, this is either caused by incorrect DDL query (same as IGN-SQL-4) or an internal Apache Ignite error.
|===

== Client Exceptions

[cols="20%,40%, 40%", width="100%",opts="header"]
|===
|Exception Code	|Description|Recommended Action

|`IGN-CLIENT-1`|Connection to client failed. This error is usually caused by incorrect address or connection timeout.|Check the exception message.  If a timeout occurred, make sure the timeout values in client and server configurations allow for long-running requests.
|`IGN-CLIENT-2`|An issue occurred with connection protocol. This error can be caused by using an incompatible client version or data corruption.|Check the exception message. If data corruption occurred, recover the data. If client versions are not compatible, use the correct client version.
|`IGN-CLIENT-3`|Protocol version does not support a specific feature. Typically this is caused by version mismatch between client and server.|Update the client or the server to a newer version or do not use incompatible features.
|`IGN-CLIENT-4`|Failed to find the table by ID.|Check if the table ID is correct.
|`IGN-CLIENT-5`|An error occurred with client configuration.|Check the exception message for more information and fix the client configuration.
|`IGN-CLIENT-6`|Cluster ID mismatch. This error can be caused by the client connecting to multiple different clusters.|Check client configuration to make sure all endpoints belong to the same cluster.
|`IGN-CLIENT-7`|Client SSL configuration is not valid.|Check the exception message for more information. Make sure SSL configuration matches server-side configuration.
|`IGN-CLIENT-8`|Client handshake message error. This is usually caused by the client trying to connect to a wrong endpoint (for example, REST) or a non-Apache Ignite process is trying to connect to a Apache Ignite endpoint.|Check the exception message for more information. If the issue is with client, check and fix client configuration. If a third-party client is trying to connect, check what it is and fix the configuration.
|`IGN-CLIENT-9`|Server to client request failed.|Check the network connectivity, client availability, and server logs for errors.
|===
