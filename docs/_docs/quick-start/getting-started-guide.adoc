= Getting Started Guide

This guide provides essential details on how to start working with Ignite 3.0 alpha 2 by using the Ignite CLI tool, including the following information:

* How to download and install the tool.
* How to use the Ignite CLI tool to manage nodes.
* How to run built-in examples.
* Additional information regarding the use of the tool.

== Prerequisites


Ignite 3.0 alpha 2 was officially tested on:

include::../includes/prereqs.adoc[]


== Installing Ignite CLI Tool


To download and install the Ignite CLI Tool, follow the steps below:

. Download the archive with the Ignite CLI tool:
+
[tabs]
--
tab:Unix[]
[source,shell]
----
curl -L "https://www.apache.org/dyn/mirrors/mirrors.cgi?action=download&filename=ignite/3.0.0-alpha2/apache-ignite-3.0.0-alpha2.zip" -o apache-ignite-3.0.0-alpha2.zip
----

tab:Windows (PowerShell)[]
[source,shell]
----
include::../includes/ignite-cli-download-windows.adoc[tag=command,indent=0]
----

tab:Windows (CMD)[]
[source,shell]
----
include::../includes/ignite-cli-download-windows.adoc[tag=command,indent=0]
----
--

. Unpack the archive:
+
[tabs]
--
tab:Unix[]
[source,shell]
----
unzip apache-ignite-3.0.0-alpha2.zip && cd apache-ignite-3.0.0-alpha2
----

tab:Windows (PowerShell)[]
[source,shell]
----
Expand-Archive apache-ignite-3.0.0-alpha2.zip -DestinationPath . ; cd apache-ignite-3.0.0-alpha2
----

tab:Windows (CMD)[]
[source,shell]
----
tar -xf apache-ignite-3.0.0-alpha2.zip & cd apache-ignite-3.0.0-alpha2
----
--

. Add your installation directory to the PATH environment variable:
+
[tabs]
--
tab:Unix[]
[source,shell]
----
echo 'export PATH="'`pwd`':$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile
----

tab:Windows (PowerShell)[]
[source,shell]
----
$ENV:PATH += ";."
----

tab:Windows (CMD)[]
[source,text]
----
set PATH=%cd%;%PATH%
----
--

NOTE: On Windows, this latter change is not permanent and will only affect the current terminal session. If you want the
`ignite` command to be available after terminal or system restart, use the `System Properties` dialog to
permanently update the `PATH` environment variable by adding a full path to the Ignite installation directory.

== Using Ignite CLI Tool

Ignite CLI is a single entry point for all the Ignite operations. You can perform the following actions with it:

* Manage existing nodes.
* Install new nodes.
* Update old nodes to new versions.
* Install or remove optional modules.

Let's use some of the \<<Ignite CLI Tool Commands>>.

. Use the command below to see the full list:
+
[source, shell]
----
ignite
----

. Pass the `--help` parameter to the previous command to get its detailed description:
+
[source, shell]
----
ignite init --help
----

== Installing Ignite Artifacts and Dependencies

Ignite CLI allows to install Ignite modules and 3rd party Maven dependencies.

. To start an Ignite 3.0 alpha 2 cluster, you need to install Ignite core artifacts first:
+
[source, shell]
----
ignite init
----

. Use the `module add` command to download Guava from Maven and add it to the Ignite classpath:
+
[source, shell]
----
ignite module add mvn:com.google.guava:guava:23.0
----

. Confirm the library is added to the Ignite dependencies list:
+
[source, shell]
----
ignite module list
----

== Starting a Node

This section explains how to start a node, how to stop, and perform other basic operations with it.

. Start a cluster node setting `node-1` as a node unique identifier:
+
[source, shell]
----
ignite node start --config=examples/config/ignite-config.json node-1
----

. Confirm the node is started and running:
+
[source, shell]
----
ignite node list
----
+
This command also displays the path to the log file.

. To view the log, use the log file path from the previous step result. To open the log file, use any suitable approach.
For example, use the `cat` command on a Unix operating system.

== Built-in Examples

Ignite 3.0 alpha 2 comes with examples that are configured as a separate Maven project located in the `examples` folder.

The project includes the following examples:

* `TableExample` demonstrates the usage of the `org.apache.ignite.table.Table` API to create a table. It also shows how to get data from a table, or insert a line into a table.
* `KeyValueBinaryViewExample` - demonstrates the usage of the `org.apache.ignite.table.KeyValueBinaryView` API to insert a line into a table.

To run an example:

1. Import the `examples` folder into your IDE as a Maven project.

2. Follow the steps in the specific example to start it.


== Stopping the Cluster

To stop the node, use the command below passing `myFirstNode` as a node unique identifier:
[source, shell]
----
ignite node stop myFirstNode
----
