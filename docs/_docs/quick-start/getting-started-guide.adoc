= Getting Started Guide

This guide provides essential details on how to start working with Ignite 3.0 Beta by using the Ignite CLI tool, including the following information:

* How to use the Ignite CLI tool to manage nodes.
* How to run built-in examples.
* Additional information regarding the use of the tool.

== Prerequisites


Ignite 3.0 Beta was officially tested on:

include::../includes/prereqs.adoc[]

== Starting Ignite Node

In this guide we will use a link:../installation/installing-using-zip[zip] archive installation. To start an Ignite node, go to the `ignite3-db-3.0.0-beta1` folder and run the following command:


[tabs]
--
tab:Linux[]
----
bin/ignite3db start
----

tab:Windows[]
NOTE: You need to install Java in Bash environment to run Ignite on Windows.
----
bash bin\ignite3db start
----
--



== Using Ignite CLI Tool

Ignite CLI is a single entry point for all the Ignite operations. In this guide we will use it to start a cluster on a node you started on the previous step and execute a simple SQL query.

//* Manage existing nodes.
//* Install new nodes.
//* Update old nodes to new versions.
//* Install or remove optional modules.

tab:Linux[]

ignite3-cli-3.0.0-beta1/bin/ignite3
----

tab:Windows[]
NOTE: You need to install Java in Bash environment to run Ignite 3 beta on Windows.
----
bash ignite3-cli-3.0.0-beta1\bin\ignite3
----
--

After you start the node, you need to initialize a cluster. To do this, use the `cluster init` command:

----
cluster init -n=sampleCluster -m=defaultNode
----

This command creates a simple cluster you can interact with. For example, you can perform sql requests from the command line, or use the thin client to perform requests.

NOTE: If you have issues with Ignite 3 Alpha, check the logs in the `ignite3-db-3.0.0-beta1/log` folder.


* Use the `CREATE TABLE` statement to create a new table:
+
----
sql "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Person (id int primary key,  city varchar,  name varchar,  age int,  company varchar)"
----
+
* Fill the table with data by using `INSERT` statement:
+
----
sql "INSERT INTO Person (id, city, name, age, company) VALUES ('1', 'London', 'John Doe', '42', 'Apache')"
sql "INSERT INTO Person (id, city, name, age, company) VALUES ('2', 'New York', 'Jane Doe', '36', 'Apache')"
----
+
* Get all data you inserted on previous step:
+
----
sql "SELECT * FROM Person"
----

NOTE: For more information about available SQL statements, see the link:sql-reference/ddl[SQL Reference] section.

== Stopping the Cluster

After you are done working on the cluster, you need to stop the node. Go to the `ignite3-db-3.0.0-beta1` folder and run the following command:


[tabs]
--
tab:Linux[]
----
bin/ignite3db stop
----

tab:Windows[]
----
bash bin\ignite3db stop
----
--
