= Distributed Computing

Ignite 3 provides an API for distributing computations across cluster nodes in a balanced and fault-tolerant manner. You can submit individual tasks for execution from Java and .NET clients.

Compute tasks execute user code on nodes. Thus, before submitting a compute job, you should link:developers-guide/code-deployment/code-deployment[deploy] the code you want to execute to the nodes where you plan to perform your computing jobs. Depending on your needs, jobs may be executed on a single node, several nodes, or all nodes in the cluster. Ignite also provides APIs for asynchronous job execution.

Often, compute tasks work with data that is stored in the cluster, and choosing arbitrary nodes may cause additional load on the cluster, as required data is sent to the node. You can avoid this by performing <<Colocated Computations>>. In this case, tasks will be executed on nodes that hold the data required for them.

Compute jobs are submitted to specific nodes in the cluster. If other nodes are required, internal cluster connections will be used to send them the data.

User objects must be link:developers-guide/compute/serialization[marshalled] before sending them to the node. For most common scenarios (tuples, POJOs, native types), this will be handled automatically, but in more complicated scenarios, you may need to write your own marshalling logic.

== Executing Jobs

=== Single Node Execution

Often, you need to perform a job on one node in the cluster. In this case, there are multiple ways to start job execution:

- `submit()` - sends the job to the cluster and returns the `JobExecution` object that can be used to monitor or modify the compute job execution.
- `executeAsync()` - sends the job to the cluster and gets the future for job execution results.
- `execute()` - sends the job to the cluster and waits for the result of job execution.

All of the methods above execute the job on one randomly chosen node from the list of nodes provided.

The example below assumes that the `NodeNameJob` class has been deployed to the node by using link:developers-guide/code-deployment/code-deployment[code deployment].

=== Multiple Node Execution

To execute the compute task on multiple nodes, you use one of the following methods:

- `submitBroadcast()` - sends the job to all provided nodes in the cluster and returns the map from the `ClusterNode` to the `JobExecution` object that can be used to monitor or modify the compute job execution.
- `executeBroadcastAsync()` - sends the job to all provided nodes in the cluster and gets the future for job execution results.
- `executeBroadcast()` - sends the job to all provided nodes in the cluster and waits for the result of job execution.

You can control what nodes the task is executed on by setting the list of nodes:

std::string result = execution.get_result()->get<std::string>();

== Job Ownership

If the cluster has link:administrators-guide/security/authentication[Authentication] enabled, compute jobs are executed by a specific user. If user permissions are configured on the cluster, the user needs the appropriate link:administrators-guide/security/permissions#distributed-computing[distributed computing permissions] to work with distributed computing jobs. Only users with `JOBS_ADMIN` action can interact with jobs of other users.

== Job Execution States

When using asynchronous API, you can keep track of the status of the job on the server and react to status changes. For example:

=== Possible States and Transitions

The diagram below depicts the possible transitions of job statuses:

image::images/compute_job_statuses.png[]

The table below lists the possible job statuses:

[width="100%",cols="20%,60%,20%"]
|=======================================================================
|Status |Description |Transitions to

| `Submitted` | The job was created and sent to the cluster, but not yet processed. | `Queued`, `Canceled`
| `Queued` | The job was added to the queue and waiting queue for execution. | `Executing`, `Canceled`
| `Executing` | The job is being executed. | `Canceling`, `Completed`, `Queued`
| `Completed` | The job was executed successfully and the execution result was returned. |
| `Failed` | The job was unexpectedly terminated during execution. | `Queued`
| `Canceling` | Job has received the cancel command, but is still running. | `Completed`, `Canceled`
| `Canceled` | Job was successfully cancelled. |

|=======================================================================

If all job execution threads are busy, new jobs received by the node are put into job queue according to their <<Job Priority>>. Ignite sorts all incoming jobs first by priority, then by the time, executing jobs queued earlier first.

=== Cancelling Executing Jobs

When the node receives the command to cancel the job in the `Executing` status, it will immediately send an interrupt to the thread that is responsible for the job. In most cases, this will lead to the job being immediately canceled, however there are cases in which the job will continue. If this happens, the job will be in the `Canceling` state. Depending on specific code being executed, the job may complete successfully, be canceled once the uninterruptible operation is finished, or remain in unfinished state (for example, if code is stuck in a loop). You can use the `JobExecution.stateAsync()` method to keep track of what status the job is in, and react to status change.


== Job Configuration

=== Job Priority

You can specify a job priority by setting the `JobExecutionOptions.priority` property. Jobs with a higher priority will be queued before jobs with lower priority (for exammple, a job with priority 4 will be executed before the job with priority 2).

== Job Failover

Ignite 3 implements mechanics to handle issues that happen during job execution. The following situations are handled:

=== Worker Node Shutdown

If the [.tooltip]#worker node# is shut down, the [.tooltip]#coordinator node# will redistribute all jobs assigned to worker to other viable nodes. If no nodes are found, the job will fail and an exception will be sent to the client.

=== Coordinator Node Shutdown

If the coordinator node shuts down, all jobs will be cancelled as soon as the node detects that the coordinator is shut down. Note that link:developers-guide/compute/compute#cancelling-executing-jobs[some jobs] may take a long time to cancel.

=== Client Disconnect

If the client disconnects, all jobs will be cancelled as soon as the coordinator node detects the disconnect. Note that link:developers-guide/compute/compute#cancelling-executing-jobs[some jobs] may take a long time to cancel.

== Colocated Computations

In Ignite 3 you can execute colocated computation with `colocated` job target. When you do it, the compute task is guaranteed to be executed on the nodes that hold the specified key. This can significantly reduce execution time if your tasks require data.

== MapReduce Tasks

Ignite 3 provides an API for performing MapReduce operations in the cluster. This allows you to split your computing task between multiple nodes before aggregating the result and returning it to the user.

=== Understanding MapReduce Tasks

A MapReduce task must be executed on a node that has a link:developers-guide/code-deployment/code-deployment[deployed] class implementing the `MapReduceTask` interface. This interface provides a way to implement custom map and reduce logic. A node that receives the task becomes a coordinator node, that will be responsible for both mapping tasks to other nodes, reducing their results and returning the final result to the client.

The class must implement two methods: `splitAsync` and `reduceAsync`.

The `splitAsync()` method should be implemented to create compute jobs based on input parameters and map them to worker nodes. The method receives the execution context and your task arguments and returns a completable future containing the list of the job descriptors that will be sent to the worker nodes.

The `reduceAsync()` method is called during the reduce step, when all the jobs have completed. The method receives a map from the worker node to the completed job result and returns the final result of the computation.

=== Creating a Mapper Class

All MapReduce jobs must be submitted to a node that has an appropriate class link:developers-guide/code-deployment/code-deployment[deployed]. Below is an example of a

            return completedFuture(context.ignite().clusterNodes().stream()
                    .map(node -> MapReduceJob.<Object, String>builder()
                            .jobDescriptor(JobDescriptor.builder(NodeNameJob.class).build())
                            .nodes(Set.of(node))
                            .args(args)
                            .build())
                    .collect(Collectors.toList()));
        }

        @Override
        public CompletableFuture<String> reduceAsync(TaskExecutionContext context, Map<UUID, String> results) {
            return completedFuture(results.values().stream()
                    .map(String.class::cast)
                    .collect(Collectors.joining(",")));
        }
    }

=== Executing a MapReduce Task

To execute the MapReduce task, you use one of the following methods:

- `submitMapReduce()` - sends the MapReduce job to the cluster and returns the `TaskExecution` object that can be used to monitor or modify the compute task execution.
- `executeMapReduceAsync()` - sends the MapReduce job to the cluster in the cluster and gets the future for job execution results.
- `executeMapReduce()` - sends the job to the cluster and waits for the result of job execution.

The node that the MapReduce task is sent to must have a class implementing the `MapReduceTask` interface.
