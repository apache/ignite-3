= Ignite Clients

Ignite 3 clients connect to the cluster via a standard socket connection. Unlike in Ignite 2.x, there is no separate Thin and Thick clients in Ignite 3. All clients are 'thin'.

Clients do not become a part of the cluster topology, never hold any data, and are not used as a destination for compute calculations.

== Client Connector Configuration

Client connection parameters are controlled by the client connector configuration. By default, Ignite accepts client connections on port 10800. You can change the configuration for the node by using the link:ignite-cli-tool[CLI tool] at any time.

In Ignite 3, you can create and maintain configuration in either HOCON or JSON. The configuration file has a single root "node," called `ignite`. All configuration sections are children, grandchildren, etc., of that node. Here is what the client connector configuration looks like:

[source, json]
----
{
  "ignite" : {
    "clientConnector" : {
      "connectTimeoutMillis" : 5000,
      "idleTimeoutMillis" : 0,
      "listenAddresses" : "",
      "metricsEnabled" : false,
      "port" : 10800,
      "sendServerExceptionStackTraceToClient" : false,
      "ssl" : {
        "ciphers" : "",
        "clientAuth" : "none",
        "enabled" : false,
          "keyStore" : {
            "password" : "********",
            "path" : "",
            "type" : "PKCS12"
        },
        "trustStore" : {
          "password" : "********",
          "path" : "",
          "type" : "PKCS12"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Set this property to true to include the full stack trace, which will appear as part of the client-side exception.

Here is how you can change the parameters:

== Client Connection

When Ignite client is starting (when the `build()` or `buildAsync()` method is called), it tries to connect to all configured endpoints one by one in the specified order, and returns as soon as one connection is established. If the client fails to connect to any nodes, the initialization fails.

Once the client connects to the cluster, it keeps attempting to connect to all other specified nodes in the background, and uses them as failover in case the connection to the primary node is interrupted. Client does not directly connect to nodes not specified in its configuration, but is aware of them through cluster topology and can send indirect write or read requests.

An inactive client sends periodic heartbeat messages to the cluster to confirm that it is still active and running. If no heartbeat messages are received for the duration specified in the `idleTimeoutMillis` configuration, the client will be disconnected. By default, the heartbeat interval is equal to half the idle timeout or 30 seconds, whichever is shorter.


== Partition Awareness

As data in the cluster is distributed between the nodes, the client can improve throughput by immediately sending updates and read requests to target nodes holding the data.

image::images/partitionawareness02.png[Partition Awareness]

For each key that needs updating, the client will get the name of the node holding its primary partition and then send an update directly to this node. If there is an active connection to this node, the update will be sent directly to it. Otherwise, the update will be sent to a random node on the list to be redirected to the target node. As such, it is recommended to list all cluster nodes in client configuration to reduce unnecessary network load.

NOTE: Partition awareness assumes that the cluster is stable. Client receives information about cluster data assignments in the background, and it may be outdated by the time an update is sent. If it is, nodes will automatically redirect requests to correct nodes until data on the client is updated.

The following table outlines features supported by each client.
