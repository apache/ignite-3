= Java Client

Ignite 3 clients connect to the cluster via a standard socket connection. Unlike Ignite 2.x, there is no separate Thin and Thick clients in Ignite 3. All clients are 'thin'.

Clients do not become a part of the cluster topology, never hold any data, and are not used as a destination for compute calculations.

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

To use Java thin client, Java 11 or newer is required.

=== Installation

Java client can be added to your project by using maven:

[source, xml, subs="attributes,specialchars"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.ignite</groupId>
    <artifactId>ignite-client</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

== Connecting to Cluster

To initialize a client, use the `IgniteClient` class, and provide it with the configuration:

[tabs]
--
tab:Java[]
[source, java]
----
try (IgniteClient client = IgniteClient.builder()
  .addresses("127.0.0.1:10800")
  .build()
) {
  // Your code goes here
}
----
--

== Authentication

To pass link:administrators-guide/security/authentication#user-authorization[authentication] information, use the `IgniteClientAuthenticator` class and pass it to `IgniteClient` builder:

[tabs]
--
tab:Java[]
[source, java]
----
IgniteClientAuthenticator auth = BasicAuthenticator.builder().username("myUser").password("myPassword").build();
IgniteClient.builder()
    .addresses("127.0.0.1:10800")
    .authenticator(auth)
    .build();
----
--

== Logging

To configure client logging, add `loggerFactory`:

[source, java]
----
IgniteClient client = IgniteClient.builder()
    .addresses("127.0.0.1")
    .loggerFactory(System::getLogger)
    .build();
----

The client logs connection errors, reconnects, and retries.

== Client Metrics

=== Java

When running Java client, you need to enable metrics in the client builder:

[source, java]
----
IgniteClient client = IgniteClient.builder()
  .addresses("127.0.0.1:10800")
  .metricsEnabled(true)
  .build();
----

After that, client metrics will be available to any Java monitoring tool, for example link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/jdk-mission-control.html[JDK Mission Control].

|=======================================================================
|Metric name | Description

|ConnectionsActive|The number of currently active connections.
|ConnectionsEstablished|The number of established connections.
|ConnectionsLost|The number of connections lost.
|ConnectionsLostTimeout|The number of connections lost due to a timeout.
|HandshakesFailed|The number of failed handshakes.
|HandshakesFailedTimeout|The number of handshakes that failed due to a timeout.
|RequestsActive|The number of currently active requests.
|RequestsSent|The number of requests sent.
|RequestsCompleted|The number of completed requests. Requests are completed once a response is received.
|RequestsRetried|The number of request retries.
|RequestsFailed|The number of failed requests.
|BytesSent|The amount of bytes sent.
|BytesReceived|The amount of bytes received.
|StreamerBatchesSent|The number of data streamer batches sent.
|StreamerItemsSent|The number of data streamer items sent.
|StreamerBatchesActive|The number of existing data streamer batches.
|StreamerItemsQueued|The number of queued data streamer items.

|=======================================================================


== Client Connection Configuration

There is a number of configuration properties managing the connection between the client and Ignite cluster:

[source, java]
----
IgniteClient client = IgniteClient.builder()
  .addresses("127.0.0.1:10800")
  .connectTimeout(5000)
  .heartbeatInterval(30000)
  .heartbeatTimeout(5000)
  .operationTimeout(3000)
  .backgroundReconnectInterval(30000)
  .retryPolicy(new RetryLimitPolicy().retryLimit(8))
  .build();
----

[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",opts="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Configuration name | Description

|connectTimeout|Client connection timeout, in milliseconds.
|heartbeatInterval|Heartbeat message interval, in milliseconds.
|heartbeatTimeout|Heartbeat message timeout, in milliseconds.
|operationTimeout|Operation timeout, in milliseconds.
|backgroundReconnectInterval|Background reconnect interval, in milliseconds.
|retryPolicy|Retry policy. By default, all read operations are retried  up to 16 times, and write operations are not retried.
