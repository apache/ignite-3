= Java SQL API

In your Java projects, you can use the Java SQL API to execute SQL statements and getting results.

== Creating Tables

Here is an example of how you can create a new table on a cluster:

[source, java]
----
client.sql().executeScript(
    "CREATE TABLE CITIES ("
        + "ID INT PRIMARY KEY,"
        + "NAME VARCHAR);"
        + "CREATE TABLE ACCOUNTS ("
        + "ACCOUNT_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,"
        + "CITY_ID INT,"
        + "FIRST_NAME VARCHAR,"
        + "LAST_NAME VARCHAR,"
        + "BALANCE DOUBLE)"
);
----

=== Using Sequences

When creating a table, you can designate the primary key column to be filled automatically from the sequence the values for your primary key by using sql sequences:

[source, java]
----
client.sql().execute(null, "CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS defaultSequence;");
client.sql().execute(
    null,
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Person ("
        + "ID BIGINT DEFAULT NEXTVAL('defaultSequence') PRIMARY KEY, "
        + "CITY_ID BIGINT, "
        + "NAME VARCHAR, "
        + "AGE INT, "
        + "COMPANY VARCHAR)"
);

System.out.println("\nInsert rows...");

client.sql().execute(
    null,
    "INSERT INTO Person (CITY_ID, NAME, AGE, COMPANY) VALUES "
        + "(1, 'Alice', 30, 'Google'), "
        + "(2, 'Bob', 40, 'Meta'), "
        + "(3, 'Charlie', 25, 'Spotify')"
);
----


== Filling Tables

With GridGain 9, you can fill the table by adding rows one by one, or in a batch. In both cases, you create an `INSERT` statement, and then exe—Åute it:

[source, java]
----
rowsAdded = Arrays.stream(
    client.sql().executeBatch(
        tx,
        "INSERT INTO ACCOUNTS (ACCOUNT_ID, CITY_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, BALANCE) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
        BatchedArguments.of(1, 1, "John", "Doe", 1000.0d)
            .add(2, 1, "Jane", "Roe", 2000.0d)
            .add(3, 2, "Mary", "Major", 1500.0d)
            .add(4, 3, "Richard", "Miles", 1450.0d)
    )
).sum();
----


== Partition-Specific SELECTs

When executing a SELECT operation, you can use the system `\__part` column to only `SELECT` data in a specific partition. To find out partition information, use the SELECT request that explicitly includes the `__part` column as its part:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT city_id, id, "__part"  FROM Person;
----

Once you know the partition, you can use it in the `WHERE` clause:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT city_id, id FROM Person WHERE "__part"=23;
----


== Getting Data From Tables

To get data from a table, execute the `SELECT` statement to get a set of results. SqlRow can provide access to column values by column name or column index. You can then iterate through results to get data.

NOTE: Always close the `ResultSet`, either by using a `try-with-resources` statement or by calling its `close()` method directly.

[source, java]
----
try (ResultSet<SqlRow> rs = client.sql().execute(
    null,
    "SELECT a.FIRST_NAME, a.LAST_NAME, c.NAME FROM ACCOUNTS a "
        + "INNER JOIN CITIES c ON c.ID = a.CITY_ID ORDER BY a.ACCOUNT_ID"
)) {
    while (rs.hasNext()) {
        SqlRow row = rs.next();

        System.out.println(
            "    " + row.stringValue(0) + ", "
                + row.stringValue(1) + ", "
                + row.stringValue(2)
        );
    }
}
----

== SQL Scripts

The default API executes SQL statements one at a time. For large SQL statements, pass them to the `executeScript()` method. The statements will be batched together similar to using `SET STREAMING` command in GridGain 8, significantly improving performance when executing a large number of queries at once. These statements will be executed in order.

[tabs]
--
tab:Java[]
[source, java]
----
String script = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Person (id int primary key, name varchar, age int default 0);"
+ "INSERT INTO Person (id, name, age) VALUES ('1', 'John', '46');";
client.sql().executeScript(script);
----
--

NOTE: Execution of each statement is considered complete when the first page is ready to be returned. As a result, when working with large data sets, SELECT statement may be affected by later statements in the same script.

=== Query Cancellation

To cancel a query, create and pass the cancellation token to the execution method:

[tabs]
--
tab:Java[]
----
CancelHandle cancelHandle = CancelHandle.create();
CancellationToken cancelToken = cancelHandle.token();

ignite.sql().execute(null, cancelToken, "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Person (id int primary key, name varchar, age int);");
----

tab:C++[]
----
std::shared_ptr<cancel_handle> handle = cancel_handle::create();
std::shared_ptr<cancellation_token> token = handle->get_token();

client.get_sql().execute(nullptr, token.get(), "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Person (id int primary key, name varchar, age int);", {});
----
--

After the query is submitted, you can cancel all queries that use the tokens from the same `cancelHandle` object at any point by using the `cancel()` or `cancelAsync()` methods, for example:

[tabs]
--
tab:Java[]
----
CompletableFuture<Void> cancelled = cancelHandle.cancelAsync();
----
tab: .NET[]
----
var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
await using var resultSet = await Client.Sql.ExecuteAsync(null, "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Person (id int primary key)", cts.Token);
await cts.CancelAsync();
----
tab:C++[]
----
handle->cancel_async(ignite_result<void> cancellationResult) {
	// Handle cancellationResult here
});
----
--

Another way to cancel queries is by using the SQL link:sql-reference/operational-commands#kill-query[KILL QUERY] command. The query id can be retrieved via the `SQL_QUERIES` link:administrators-guide/metrics/system-views[system view].
