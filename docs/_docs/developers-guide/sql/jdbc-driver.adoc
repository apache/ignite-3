= JDBC Driver

Ignite is shipped with JDBC driver that allows processing of distributed data using standard SQL statements like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` directly from the JDBC side.

This implementation of JDBC driver does not support the following functionality:

* SSL/TLS connection;
* Multiple Endpoints;
* Multi-statement requests;
* `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `WITH`, and `MERGE` commands.

== Setting Up

JDBC driver uses the client connector to work with the cluster. For more information on configuring client connector, see link:clients/overview#client-connector-configuration[Client Connector Configuration].

Here is how you can open a JDBC connection to the cluster node listening on IP address `192.168.0.50`:

[source, java]
----
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:ignite:thin://192.168.0.50:10800");
----

The driver connects to one of the cluster nodes and forwards all the queries to it for final execution. The node handles the query distribution and the resultâ€™s aggregations. Then the result is sent back to the client application.

The JDBC connection string may be formatted with one of two patterns: `URL query` or `semicolon`:

[source, java]
----
// URL query pattern
jdbc:ignite:thin://<hostAndPortRange0>[,<hostAndPortRange1>]...[,<hostAndPortRangeN>][/schema][?<params>]

hostAndPortRange := host[:port_from[..port_to]]

params := param1=value1[&param2=value2]...[&paramN=valueN]

// Semicolon pattern
jdbc:ignite:thin://<hostAndPortRange0>[,<hostAndPortRange1>]...[,<hostAndPortRangeN>][;schema=<schema_name>][;param1=value1]...[;paramN=valueN]
----

* `host` is required and defines the host of the cluster node to connect to.
* `port_from` is the beginning of the port range to use to open the connection. 10800 is used by default if this parameter is omitted.
* `port_to` is optional. It is set to the `port_from` value by default if this parameter is omitted.
* `schema` is the schema name to access. PUBLIC is used by default. This name should correspond to the SQL ANSI-99 standard. Non-quoted identifiers are not case sensitive. Quoted identifiers are case sensitive. When semicolon format is used, the schema may be defined as a parameter with name schema.
* `<params>` are optional parameters. The following parameters are available:
- `username` - user name for basic authentication to the cluster.
- `password` - user password for basic authentication to the cluster.


== Performing Transactions

With the JDBC driver, you can  perform `commit` and `rollback` transactions. For more information about transactions, see link:transactions/performing-transactions[Performing Transactions].

Here is how you can commit a transaction:

[source, java]
----
// Open the JDBC connection.
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:ignite:thin://192.168.0.50:10800");

// Commit a transaction
conn.commit();
----

You can also configure Ignite to automatically commit transactions by using the `setAutoCommit()` method.

Here is how you can rollback a transaction:

[source, java]
----
conn.rollback();
----

== Running an Example

Examples are shipped as a separate Maven project, which is located in the `examples` folder. `SqlJdbcExample` demonstrates the usage of the Ignite JDBC driver.

To run `SqlJdbcExample`, perform the following steps:

. Import the examples project into your IDE;
. Start a server node using the CLI tool:
+
[source, shell]
----
ignite node start --config=$IGNITE_HOME/examples/config/ignite-config.json my-first-node
----
. Run `SqlJdbcExample` in the IDE.
