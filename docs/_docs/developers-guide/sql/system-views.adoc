= System Views

Ignite provides a number of built-in SQL views that provide information on the cluster's state and provide real-time insight into the status of its components. These views are available in the SYSTEM schema.

== Getting Data

You access system views in Ignite by using SQL and selecting data from the system view like you would from any other table.  For example, you can get a list of all available system views in the following way:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM system.system_views
----

You can also use joins to combine data from multiple views. The example below returns all columns of a view that was found in the `SYSTEM_VIEWS` view:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT svc.*
  FROM system.system_view_columns svc
  JOIN system.system_views sv ON svc.view_id = sv.id
 WHERE sv.name = 'SYSTEM_VIEWS'
----
