= System Views

Ignite provides a number of built-in SQL views that provide information on the cluster's state and provide real-time insight into the status of its components. These views are available in the SYSTEM schema.

== Getting Data

You access system views in Ignite by using SQL and selecting data from the system view like you would from any other table. For example, you can get a list of all available system views in the following way:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT id, schema, name FROM system.system_views WHERE type = 'NODE'
----

You can also use joins to combine data from multiple views. The example below returns all columns of a view that was found in the `SYSTEM_VIEWS` view:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT svc.*
  FROM system.system_view_columns svc
  JOIN system.system_views sv ON svc.view_id = sv.id
 WHERE sv.name = 'SYSTEM_VIEWS'
----

== Available Views

=== SYSTEM_VIEWS

Describes available system views.

[width="100%", cols="15%a, 15%a, 60%a",opts="header"]
|=======
|Column	|Data Type| Description

| ID | INT32 | System view ID.
| SCHEMA | STRING | Name of the schema used. Default is `SYSTEM`.
| NAME | STRING | System view name.
| TYPE | STRING | System view type. Possible values:

* NODE - The view provides node-specific information. Data will be collected from all nodes, and represented in the view.
* CLUSTER - The view provides cluster-wide information. Data will be collected from one node, chosen to represent the cluster.
