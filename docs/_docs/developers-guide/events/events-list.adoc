These events describe the possible states of a compute job.

[width="100%", cols="30%,70%",opts="header", stripes=none]
|=======

|Event Type
|Description

|Triggered when a compute job is added to the execution queue.

|COMPUTE_JOB_EXECUTING,
|Triggered when a compute job starts execution.

|COMPUTE_JOB_FAILED,

|Field Name
|Description

|type
|Type of the compute job. Could be `SINGLE`, `BROADCAST`, `MAP_REDUCE` or `DATA_RECEIVER`.

Single job is the most common type, assigned to jobs that are executed on a single node. Broadcast jobs are executed on many nodes simultaneously. Map reduce jobs are the jobs that are submitted from the map reduce task. Data receiver is an internal compute job that is used when data streamer API is used.

|className
|Class name of a job.

|jobId
|Compute job ID.

|targetNode
|Name of the node where a job is executed.

|initiatorNode
|Name of the node where a submit request is processed.

|taskId
|*Optional* Сommon ID for all broadcast compute jobs submitted from a single invocation.

|tableName
|*Optional* Table name for colocated jobs or partitioned broadcast jobs.

|clientAddress
|*Optional* A socket address of a thin client that submitted a job.
