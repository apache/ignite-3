= Table Views

Apache Ignite 3.0 Alpha introduces the key-value API to access cached data via built-in table views.

== Key-Value View

This table view maps key objects to value objects. The view cannot contain duplicate key objects; each key object can map to at most one value object.

=== Running an Example

Examples are shipped as a separate Maven project, which is located in the `examples` folder. `KeyValueViewExample` demonstrates the usage of the key-value view.

To start running `KeyValueViewExample`, please refer to its link:https://github.com/apache/ignite-3/blob/main/examples/src/main/java/org/apache/ignite/example/table/KeyValueViewExample.java[JavaDoc,window=_blank] for instructions.

== Record View

This table view provides methods to access table records.

=== Running an Example

Examples are shipped as a separate Maven project, which is located in the `examples` folder. `RecordViewExample` demonstrates the usage of the record view.

To start running `RecordViewExample`, please refer to its link:https://github.com/apache/ignite-3/blob/main/examples/src/main/java/org/apache/ignite/example/table/RecordViewExample.java[JavaDoc,window=_blank] for instructions.

== Record Binary View

NOTE: This is a table view implementation for binary objects.

You can use binary objects to access the cached data. The benefit of using binary objects is that you avoid deserialization, which is important if you access objects from a server node that does not have the objectâ€™s class representation.

For more information on record binary view, please see the following link:https://github.com/apache/ignite-3/blob/main/modules/table/src/main/java/org/apache/ignite/internal/table/RecordBinaryViewImpl.java[implementation example,window=_blank].
