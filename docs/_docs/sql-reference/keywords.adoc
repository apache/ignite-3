= Keywords

This topic covers keywords in Apache Ignite 3.

Non-reserved keywords can be used as identifiers (names for tables, columns, etc.) without requiring quotation marks or special escaping. These keywords have meaning in SQL contexts but do not conflict with basic SQL grammar.

Reserved keywords must be wrapped in double quotes to be used as identifiers, for example, table names or column names. If a reserved word is used as an identifier without being quoted, a syntax error will happen.

[source, sql]
----
-- Valid keyword usage.
SELECT 1 AS "ABS";

-- The query below would cause an error.
-- SELECT 1 AS ABS;
----

The following list shows the keywords in Apache Ignite {version}.
