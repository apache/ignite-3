== Running Apache Ignite as a Service

NOTE: When running on Windows 10 WSL or Docker, you should start Apache Ignite as a stand-alone process (not as a service). We recommend to link:installation/installing-using-zip[install Apache Ignite 3 using ZIP archive] in these environments.

To start an Apache Ignite node with a custom configuration, run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
sudo systemctl start ignite3db
----

To launch the node at system startup, run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
sudo systemctl enable ignite3db
----


== Running Apache Ignite as a Stand-Alone Process

Generally, you would want to run Apache Ignite as a service. However, Apache Ignite also provides a startup script that can be used to start it as a stand-alone application. To run it, use the following command:

[source, bash]
----
sudo bash /usr/share/ignite3db/start.sh 1>/tmp/ignite3-start.log 2>&1 &
----

== Next Steps

With Apache Ignite installed, you can proceed with the link:quick-start/getting-started-guide[Getting Started] or link:developers-guide/table-api[use the available APIs] immediately.
